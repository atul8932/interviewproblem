### 1. **279B ‚Äî Books**

**Problem:**
You have `n` books in a row; each book takes `t[i]` minutes to read. You have total time `T`. You want to read a consecutive sequence of books. Find the **maximum number of books** you can read without exceeding `T`.

**Approach:**

* Use **sliding window**.
* Maintain two pointers `left` and `right`. Expand `right` adding `t[right]` to sum.
* If sum > T, move `left` forward to shrink window.
* Keep track of **max window length**.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n).

### 2. **580A ‚Äî Kefa and First Steps**

**Problem:**
Given an array of integers, find the **length of the longest non-decreasing contiguous subarray**.

**Approach:**

* Two pointers: `start` and `end`.
* Expand `end` while `arr[end] >= arr[end-1]`.
* When it breaks, reset `start = end`.
* Keep track of max length.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n).

* Stop when pointers meet.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n).

**Problem:**
You can cut a tree to the left or right. No two trees can fall on each other. Maximize the number of trees that can be cut.

**Approach:**

* Two pointers simulate cutting each tree.
* Maintain previous tree position.
* If left cut possible ‚Üí cut left; else if right cut ‚Üí cut right; else leave tree.

* **Time Complexity:** O(1) (simple math).

---

### 10. **1029B ‚Äî Creating the Contest**

**Problem:**
Arrange problems in sequence so each ‚â§ 2√ó previous. Maximize number of problems used.

* If changes > k ‚Üí move left.
* Keep max window length.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n).
